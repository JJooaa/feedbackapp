## My process

### Built with

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux / Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/) - Global State Manager
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- TypeScript. I decided to pick up this language as it's important for web development in bigger projects. Its also highly liked language and it makes websites more reliable, less prone to bugs.
- Redux Toolkit. I got more experience with it and I understand it way better now. Great for global state management. 
- Sass. I didn't really deep dive into the mechanics of Sass, but I did use some of its core principles, e.g nested styling. 
- Mobile-first workflow. Absolutely will use this in all future projects. With this strategy you dont stumble as much on creating media queries and being confused. 

You can find the redux examples in in "src/slices/dataSlice.ts"

### Continued development

What are some of the things I could do better? 

- Git Workflow. Smaller commits and more clear commit messages.
- Learn more of TypeScript. First time I used TypeScript and I just dove into it without prior experience.
